This Python program asks the user for an initial balance, the amount to bet, their choice of number from 0 to 36 or red or black, and then simulates a round of roulette by generating a random number. It then determines if the user wins or loses based on their bet and updates their balance accordingly. The user can continue playing until they decide to stop or their balance becomes insufficient.
